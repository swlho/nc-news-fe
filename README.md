## Project summary
Northcoders News - a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics, and each article has user-curated ratings from upvotes and downvotes using the API. Users can also add comments about an article.

This project consolidated my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective.

Tech stack:
* React.js
* HTML/CSS
* PostgreSQL (hosted via Render and ElephantSQL)

This frontend is hooked into the backend project I created (which can be found at https://github.com/swlho/nc-news).

## Project learning outcomes:

1. Planning a React app, including consideration of state management and component design.
2. Implementing features to a front end application based on user stories.
3. Fetching data from an external API and using it to hydrate your components.
4. Implementing routing.
5. Providing user feedback based on potential errors.
6. Building a user interface that considers user experience and accessibility.
7. Applying styling to a front end application.
8. Deploying a front end project.
